              for <br />
              Because this project is in constant motion. One day I might focus
              on building a clean layout, the next day I might experiment with
              bright colors, grid systems, or even animations. These changes
              aren’t always meant to “look good,” but rather to explore what’s
              possible with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <summary>Why did you start coding?</summary>
            <p>
              I started coding out of curiosity. At first, I only wanted to make
              small edits to websites or create simple pages with text and
              images. But the deeper I went, the more I realized coding is like
              solving puzzles — there’s always a problem to figure out and a
              solution to create. That sense of building something from nothing
              is what keeps me going.
            </p>

          <details>
            <summary>
              What happens if the answer is really long and goes across multiple
              lines?
            </summary>
            <p>
              Part of testing this site is to see how it behaves with unusual
              input. Maybe a really long username, special characters, or even
              empty fields. These cases help me figure out where validation is
              needed and how to make the site more user-friendly. Sometimes
              things will break — and that’s okay, because finding those weak
              points is exactly the point of this experiment.
