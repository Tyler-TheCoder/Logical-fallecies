        <strong>Fallacies</strong> are common errors in reasoning that will
        undermine the logic of your argument. Fallacies can be either
        illegitimate arguments or irrelevant points, and are often identified
        because they lack evidence that supports their claim. Avoid these common
        fallacies in your own arguments and watch for them in the arguments of
        others.
        <h3>Slippery Slope</h3>
        <p>
          This is a conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then
          eventually through a series of small steps, through B, C,..., X, Y, Z
          will happen, too, basically equating A and Z. So, if we don't want Z
          to occur, A must not be allowed to occur either.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>
            If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment
            eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban
            Hummers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author is equating banning Hummers with banning
          all cars, which is not the same thing.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Hasty Generalization</h3>
        <p>
          This is a conclusion based on insufficient or biased evidence. In
          other words, you are rushing to a conclusion before you have all the
          relevant facts.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <p>
            Even though it's only the first day, I can tell this is going to be
            a boring course.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author is basing his evaluation of the entire
          course on only the first day, which is notoriously boring and full of
          housekeeping tasks for most courses. To make a fair and reasonable
          evaluation the author must attend not one but several classes, and
          possibly even examine the textbook, talk to the professor, or talk to
          others who have previously finished the course in order to have
          sufficient evidence to base a conclusion on.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Post hoc ergo propter hoc</h3>
        <p>
          This is a conclusion that assumes that if 'A' occurred after 'B' then
          'B' must have caused 'A.'
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>
            I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made
            me sick.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author assumes that if one event chronologically
          follows another the first event must have caused the second. But the
          illness could have been caused by the burrito the night before, a flu
          bug that had been working on the body for days, or a chemical spill
          across campus. There is no reason, without more evidence, to assume
          the water caused the person to be sick.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h3>Genetic Fallacy</h3>
        <p>
          This conclusion is based on an argument that the origins of a person,
          idea, institute, or theory determine its character, nature, or worth.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example</strong>
          <p>
            The Volkswagen Beetle is an evil car because it was originally
            designed by Hitler's army.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example the author is equating the character of a car with the
          character of the people who built the car. However, the two are not
          inherently related.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Begging the Claim</h3>
        <p>
          The conclusion that the writer should prove is validated within the
          claim
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>Filthy and polluting coal should be banned.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Arguing that coal pollutes the earth and thus should be banned would
          be logical. But the very conclusion that should be proved, that coal
          causes enough pollution to warrant banning its use, is already assumed
          in the claim by referring to it as "filthy and polluting."
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Circular Argument</h3>
        <p>This restates the argument rather than actually proving it.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>
            George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the conclusion that Bush is a "good communicator" and
          the evidence used to prove it "he speaks effectively" are basically
          the same idea. Specific evidence such as using everyday language,
          breaking down complex problems, or illustrating his points with
          humorous stories would be needed to prove either half of the sentence.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Either/or</h3>
        <p>
          This is a conclusion that oversimplifies the argument by reducing it
          to only two sides or choices
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>We can either stop using cars or destroy the earth.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the two choices are presented as the only options,
          yet the author ignores a range of choices in between such as
          developing cleaner technology, car-sharing systems for necessities and
          emergencies, or better community planning to discourage daily driving.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Ad hominem</h3>
        <p>
          This is an attack on the character of a person rather than his or her
          opinions or arguments.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example : </strong>
          <p>
            Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all
            dirty, lazy hippies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author doesn't even name particular strategies
          Green Peace has suggested, much less evaluate those strategies on
          their merits. Instead, the author attacks the characters of the
          individuals in the group.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Ad populum/Bandwagon Appeal</h3>
        <p>
          This is an appeal that presents what most people, or a group of people
          think, in order to persuade one to think the same way. Getting on the
          bandwagon is one such instance of an ad populum appeal.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>
            If you were a true American you would support the rights of people
            to choose whatever vehicle they want.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author equates being a "true American," a concept
          that people want to be associated with, particularly in a time of war,
          with allowing people to buy any vehicle they want even though there is
          no inherent connection between the two.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Red Herring</h3>
        <p>
          This is a diversionary tactic that avoids the key issues, often by
          avoiding opposing arguments rather than addressing them
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <strong>Example :</strong>
          <p>
            The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers
            do to support their families?
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this example, the author switches the discussion away from the
          safety of the food and talks instead about an economic issue, the
          livelihood of those catching fish. While one issue may affect the
          other it does not mean we should ignore possible safety issues because
          of possible economic consequences to a few individuals.
        </p>
        <hr />
      <h3>Straw Man</h3>
      <p>This move oversimplifies an opponent's viewpoint and then attacks that hollow argument.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example :</strong>
        <p>People who don't support the proposed state minimum wage increase hate the poor.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, the author attributes the worst possible motive to an opponent's position. In reality, however, the opposition probably has more complex and sympathetic arguments to support their point. By not addressing those arguments, the author is not treating the opposition with respect or refuting their position.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Moral Equivalence</h3>
      <p> This fallacy compares minor misdeeds with major atrocities, suggesting that both are equally immoral.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <strong>Example :</strong>
        <p>That parking attendant who gave me a ticket is as bad as Hitler.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, the author is comparing the relatively harmless actions of a person doing their job with the horrific actions of Hitler. This comparison is unfair and inaccurate.</p>
